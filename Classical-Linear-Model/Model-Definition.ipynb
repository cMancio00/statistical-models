    "Suppose we are interested in a variable *y* and we aim to model the relationship between this **response variable** *y* and a set of **regressors** $x_{1},...,x_{k}$. We model this relationship with a function $f(x_{1},...,x_{k})$, but this is not exact because is affected by random noise $\\varepsilon$. In practice, we assume additive errors and we obtain $y = f(x_{1},...,x_{k}) + \\varepsilon$. Our goal is to find the unkwnon function $f$ and separate the **systematic component** or **signal** $f$ from the random **noise** $\\varepsilon$.\n",

    "We will do specific assumptions regarding the unknown function $f$ and the noise $\\varepsilon$:\n",
    "1. **The signal $f$ is a linear combination of covariates**<br>What does that mean? It means that $f(x_{1},...,x_{k}) = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x_{1}+...\\beta_{k}x_{k}$, the parameters $\\beta_{0},\\beta_{1},...,\\beta_{k}$ are unknown and need to be estimeted. The parameter $\\beta_{0}$ rapresents the intercept. Combining the covariates and the unknown parameters each into $p=(k+1)$ dimensional vectors, we obtain: $f(\\vec{x}) = \\vec{x}^\\intercal\\vec{\\beta}$. Where $\\vec{x} = (1,x_{1},...,x_{k})^\\intercal$ and $\\vec{\\beta} = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x_{1}+...\\beta_{k}x_{k}$.\n"
